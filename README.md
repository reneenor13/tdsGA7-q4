## Project Description
This repository contains a correlation analysis of my dataset.  
The Excel file (`q-excel-correlation-heatmap.xlsx`) includes the raw data and the correlation formulas.  
The CSV file (`correlation.csv`) contains the correlation matrix of all numerical variables.  
The PNG file (`heatmap.png`) shows the correlation matrix with Red-White-Green conditional formatting applied in Excel.  

## Files in this Repository
- `README.md` – Project information and author contact.  
- `q-excel-correlation-heatmap.xlsx` – Original dataset with correlation formulas.  
- `correlation.csv` – Correlation matrix exported from Excel.  
- `heatmap.png` – Heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix (Red-White-Green, 400–512 px).  

## Notes
- All files are required for validation.  
- The email in this README is used for project verification.
